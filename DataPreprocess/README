# The steps to preprocess the original images.

# directories & files:
'Images' directory: stores the original images that are downloaded from http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/17/.
'DataPreprocess.m': Split the original images into train & test images according to the given train.mat & test.mat.
'Images2', 'Test', 'Train', 'TrainCrop', 'TrainFlip', 'TrainNoise', 'Validation' directories: the directories that are used by DataPreprocess.m. 
'test.mat', 'train.mat': the mats which are used to split the train & test images. The 2 mats are downloaded from http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/17/.
'CreateTFRecords.py': Use the images in Train & Test directories to create train.tfrecords & test.tfrecords files.

# Usage:
Step1: Download the original images from http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/17/ and store them in 'Images/' directory.
Step2: Run 'DataPreprocess.m' file(create the directories used in 'DataPreprocess.m' if you do not have them).
Step3: Run 'CreateTFRecords.py' file.
Step4: You will get train.tfrecords & test.tfrecords files in '../Dataset/' directory after Step3.

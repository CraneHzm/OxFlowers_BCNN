# The steps to preprocess the original images.


# directories & files:
'Images' directory: stores the original images that are downloaded from http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/17/.
'DataPreprocess.m': Split the original images into train, validation & test images and augment the train data.
'CreateTFRecords.py': Use the splitted images and augmented train data to create train_aug.tfrecords, validation.tfrecords & test.tfrecords files.


# Usage:
Step1: Download the original images from http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/17/ and store them in 'Images/' directory.
Step2: Run 'DataPreprocess.m' file to split the images and augment the train images.
Step3: Run 'CreateTFRecords.py' file to create the TFRecord files.
Step4: You will get train_aug.tfrecords, validation.tfrecords & test.tfrecords files in '../Dataset/' directory after Step3.
